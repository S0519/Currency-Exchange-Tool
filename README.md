# Read ME
With the increase in international travel and business, it is important for one to understand the monetary differences based on country's exchange rates. This application assists users in understanding how much their currency is worth in
a foreign currency, while providing a history of the particular currency and any related news in regard to its exchange.


# User Story:
AS AN Currency Speculator 
I WANT TO input a specified currency and display the conversion rates for selected counties
I WANT TO visualize historical currency data
I WANT TO be presented with relevant news articles relating to selected currency
SO THAT I can be updated on my currency interests
