a foreign currency, while providing a history of the particular currency and any related news in regard to its exchange.

User Story:
AS AN Currency Speculator 
I WANT TO input a specified currency and display the conversion rates for selected counties
I WANT TO visualize historical currency data
I WANT TO be presented with relevant news articles relating to selected currency
SO THAT I can be updated on my currency interests
